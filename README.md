# LABOPS-1775 Automated testing for your network (pyATS/Genie)

This repository contains files required for the participants of Cisco Live EU 2020 Walked-in Self-paced Labs (WISP):

Abstract
================================================
Today automation of time consuming network operations is not a trend but MUST for all network engineers.
We in CX team see huge demand from our customers for all automation topics, especially for automation of network testing.
Cisco released PyATS/Genie framework for test automation and a lot of our customers struggle to implement this automation ecosystem in their networks.
This tool is have a great opportunities, but it is always hard to change way that people get used to behave previous 20 years.
We will introduce participants with reald-world examples and give them  fast start for test automation in their networks.

During the lab participants will be able to:
- learn platform capabilities
- testbed creation
- state of network validation
- test state of network after failures


As a result of the lab participant will build their own automated tests, using PyATS/Genie frameworks.
All participants will get access to lab source code to automate tests in their networks afterwards.

Technical Level
================
Intermediate

Goal of the Session
=========================================================
Provide practical experience working with PyATS/Genie for automation of networks.
Bring potential use-cases for PyATS/Genie in participants' networks.
