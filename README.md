## Abstract

Today automation of time-consuming network operations is not a trend but MUST for all network engineers.

This lab is prepared by Cisco CX engineers who see huge demand from Cisco customers for all automation topics, especially for automation of network testing.

Cisco released pyATS framework for test automation and a lot of our customers struggle to implement this automation ecosystem in their networks.

This tool has great opportunities, but it is always hard to change the way that people get used to behave previous 20 years.

This lab shows real examples from the field and gives a fast start for test automation in a network.
<br></br>
**During the lab participants will be able to**:
- Learn pyATS capabilities.
- Understand the structure of testbed file.
- Learn how to test the network before and after making a change.
- Get a solid understanding in what areas pyATS can help to start using it.

As a result of the lab, the participant will build their automated tests, using pyATS frameworks.
All participants will get access to lab source code to automate tests in their networks afterwards.

## Technical Level
